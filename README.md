Issues I had deploying Playlister:

What broke?

Heroku won't let me upload a new playlist, it says internal server error.

I tried to add a Ratings value to the playlists but that broke my ability to update the playlists, so i removed it.

I cannot get the app to display the comments attached to a playlist once I have added them, but they appear in the MongoDB Compass database.

What didn't make sense?

One of my playlists had the video links all work. The other had all of the video links break, even when I added new ones.


Did anyone around you face the same issues?
